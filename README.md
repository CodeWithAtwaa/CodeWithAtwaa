# 💫 About Me:
I am a dedicated and highly motivated Backend Developer with a strong focus on PHP and Laravel, currently pursuing my third year at the Faculty of Computers and Informatics, Zagazig University (FCI_ZU). Over the past few years, I have developed a deep interest in backend architectures, database systems, and building efficient, scalable web applications.

Alongside my academic journey, I am completing a hands-on internship at ITI Zagazig, where I am actively involved in backend development tasks, database design, API creation and integration, and understanding real-world development workflows. This experience has helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, strengthening my skills in writing clean, maintainable, and production-ready backend code.

My background in competitive programming and problem-solving has significantly shaped the way I approach software development. Through platforms like Codeforces and other algorithmic competitions, I’ve strengthened my logical thinking, pattern recognition, and ability to break down complex problems into manageable solutions. This has allowed me to write efficient code and optimize backend systems for performance and scalability.

I am always striving to improve—whether learning advanced Laravel features, exploring modern backend tools, understanding system design principles, or working with APIs and database optimization techniques. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems, experimenting with new technologies, and continuously expanding my technical skill set.

I am passionate about becoming a well-rounded backend engineer capable of designing robust architectures, building secure and scalable applications, and contributing to impactful software solutions. My current goals include deepening my understanding of backend frameworks, improving my database optimization skills, and learning more about cloud-based development and DevOps practices to enhance deployment and automation workflows.

Technology for me is not just a field of study—it’s a craft I am committed to mastering. I’m constantly motivated by the potential of software to create meaningful impact, and I’m excited to continue growing, learning, and building in the world of backend development.<br>
